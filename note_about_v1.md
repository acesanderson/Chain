### Version 1

Version 1 was created out of my frustration with Langchain, and my desire to understand the internals better.
It was an opportunity for me to learn OOP with Python while also commoditizing the various LLM SDKs.
It eventually became bloated, and was refactored entirely in v2 to handle lazy loading.
