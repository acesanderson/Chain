"""
A Chain is a convenience wrapper for models, prompts, parsers, messages, and response objects.
A chain needs to have at least a prompt and a model.
Chains are immutable, treat them like tuples.
This used to be a monolith, but now I've separated out various classes, and created Message as a new one.
