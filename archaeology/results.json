For example, many developers tend to systemize rather than empathize. They approach problems in a logical way and find it hard to see the emotional side to issues.

They have emotional responses to working with your product.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this practical course, look at what it takes to help systemizers to empathize, and how you can best integrate with development teams, communicate the value of UX to business-oriented team members, and cultivate executive champions.
